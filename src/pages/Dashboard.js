            <p className="paragraph-light">
              Always up for a challenge, I have worked across a range of lean startups and larger companies. In my first role, I was the Lead Designer for the first New Zealand startup to attend Y Combinator - the largest startup accelerator in the world. From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. I then moved to video creation company - VideoMyJob - where I led UI and UX design of the website and app. In my most recent role, I was a Senior Product Designer at Linktree leading design for the activation team and Linktree's first ever mobile app.<br />
              <br />Outside of work, I enjoy collecting 90s vintage toys, playing guitar and spending time with my wife and our two cats - Neo and Scully.

              <p>"Sebastian is a guru at all things UX design, consistently producing intuitive, modern, and bold designs. He is a natural problem solver in the design space so everyone went to him if they were stuck on a feature or flow. He has an arsenal of design skills including animation and graphic design. Not to mention, Seb was a design team lead, which means he managed a full team of both onshore and offshore designs reviewing and providing feedback on all of their designs... Any business would be lucky to have him."</p>
